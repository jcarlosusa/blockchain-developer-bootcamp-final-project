After multiple discussions, brainstorming, the people like to raise funds for greatany ideas, launching a product or service leveraging a crowdsale. And multiple investors from different levels are looking for opportunities to invest their money and be part of those ideas, projects or donations.

The Tokenomics are the economics of the future and it plays an important role in crowdsales, and crown sales have a bunch of different properties like the Price & Rate, the start day and time, end day and time, or early if cap is reached before; sell tokens at a fixed price or the price change over time or as a function of demand, and many more.

Today we have multiple Crowns Sales Ideas with successful results.
